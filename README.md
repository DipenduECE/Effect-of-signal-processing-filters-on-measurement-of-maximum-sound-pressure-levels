Sound pressure, or sound pressure level, is the result of the pressure variations in the air achieved by the sound waves. Sound-level meter is a device used for measuring the sound pressure level by measuring the intensity of noise, music, and other sounds. A typical meter consists of a microphone for picking up the sound and converting it into an electrical signal, followed by electronic circuitry for operating on this signal so that the desired characteristics can be measured. A sound level meter has four main components. These are input filters to remove unwanted frequencies from the signal that is being measured, Constant Percentage Bandwidth (CPB) filters , an A-weighting filter, and a time-weighted level detector to convert an AC signal into a DC signal. The final stages involve statistical, time-based averaging or peak detection components to determine the desired parameter. The focus of paper is to see which is better filter CPB or A or C and which must be used in sound level meter for the analysis of sound.
